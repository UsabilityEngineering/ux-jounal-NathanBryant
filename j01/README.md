# Working with a new terminal

I recently decided to switch from the macOS Terminal to **Iterm2** because I wanted a terminal emulator that offered more customization and better usability. As someone who spends alot of time in the terminal this is something I find very important. It leverages the principle of matching between system and the real world. It's Split Panes feature mimics this ability to lay out multiple sheets of paper on a desk or tabs in a notebook for concurrent work, something my old terminal did not do.
