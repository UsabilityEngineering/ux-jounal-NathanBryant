# Working with a new terminal

I recently decided to switch from the macOS Terminal to **Iterm2** because I wanted a terminal emulator that offered more customization and better usability. As someone who spends alot of time in the terminal this is something I find very important. It leverages the principle of matching between system and the real world. It's Split Panes feature mimics this ability to lay out multiple sheets of paper on a desk or tabs in a notebook for concurrent work, something my old terminal did not do.

## Experience with split panes:

My primary motivation for switching to iTerm2 from the default is to improve the multitasking effeciency, particularly for being able to run multiple commands and monitor those outputs and inputs in parallel. As well as being able to ssh in one and be in my home directory in the other one.

## Initial Expectation:

From other software I have used in the past I would expect it to be much like splitting your screen on windows or mac. And all the while being able to easily arrange them. I anticipated being able to run commands in one pane while keeping logs visible in another, akin to something like multiple browser tabs or document views.
